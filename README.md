ðŸŒ± Low-Cost Crop Disease Detector â€” Project Roadmap
â¿¡ Problem Definition
Identify solution for farmers to detect crop diseases early using smartphone camera & simple IoT sensors (temperature, humidity, soil moisture).

â¿¢ Components Needed
Smartphone (for image capture)

ESP32 board (for collecting sensor data)

Temperature & Humidity Sensor (DHT11/DHT22)

Soil Moisture Sensor

Jumper wires, Power supply

Internet connectivity

Mobile app/Web app or cloud for AI analysis

â¿£ Working Flow
Farmer clicks leaf photo from smartphone.

Photo sent to AI server/cloud via app or web, detects health/disease.

ESP32 with sensors continuously collects field temperature, humidity, and soil moisture data.

All sensor values plus image analysis result are displayed on the farmerâ€™s mobile/dashboard.

If any disease or abnormality is detected, automatic alert/notification is sent to the farmer.

â¿¤ Step-by-Step Implementation
â¬› Hardware Setup
Set up ESP32 with DHT11/DHT22 for temp/humidity and soil moisture sensor.

Connect sensors, power, and ensure WiFi connectivity.

Test sensor readings in the field.

â¬› Software/App Setup
Use a simple mobile/web app for photo upload (or any online plant disease detection platform).

Create a basic dashboard/web page (optional) for displaying real-time sensor & disease status.

â¬› AI Integration
Image is analyzed by a pretrained AI model online (like Google Teachable Machine, Plantix, or a custom cloud Python model).

Display real-time results for photo: healthy/which disease detected.

â¬› Data & Alerts
All sensor values and disease status shown to farmer on mobile/dashboard.

Automated alerts sent if disease or abnormal soil/water condition is detected.

â¬› Testing
Test full workflow: Sensor + photo + result + alerts in the actual field.

Fix issues and optimize for reliable use.

â¬› Presentation
Prepare a small demo and presentation with working hardware and app/dashboard for judges.

â¿¥ Final Output
Farmers get real-time info about their crop health and field conditions.

Early warning via mobile helps save crop and increase yield.

System is easy, low-cost, and can be used inÂ anyÂ ruralÂ area.
